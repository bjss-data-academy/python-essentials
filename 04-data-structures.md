# Built-in data structures

Python comes with powerful data structures built in to the language. They form a rich variety of ways to organise, group, store and find data.

## Tuple

A tupe is a simple group of values. the values may or may not be related to each other.

```python
favouriteFoods = ("eggs", "sausage", "chips", "beans")
print(favouriteFoods)
```

The purpose of a tuple is to package up data items that need to be considered as a single whole. If data is always used together, and needs to be represented as a single thing, a tuple might be the way to represent that data.
