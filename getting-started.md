# Getting Started

# Installing Python

Many systems have Python preinstalled, but it's sometimes an obsolete old version.

Let's check what we have by opening a terminal and doing a version check:

![Terminal showing output of command "python version" showing 3.13.1](/images/python-version.png)

This shows Python is installed and at version 3.13.1, the latest version for my computer at the time of writing. This is good to go.

## If you don't have Python installed

Head over to [python downloads](https://python.org/downloads) and use the installer for your operating system

# Hello Pythonic World!

create a text file named `hello.py` containing:

```python
print("Hello, Pythonic world!")
```

Save and close the file.

From a terminal window, run the file using `python3 hello.py`.

You should see the cheery greeting from Python:

_(if you're feeling particularly lazy, the code is [here)(/src/hello.py), all one line of it :)_
